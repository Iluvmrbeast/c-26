 You can pick up your staples at your local asian food market or in  your grocery store’s international food aisle. Nearly every store I ’ve been to carries all the above ingredients and some even arrange them next to the store-made sushi for easy stock-up! Sweet!

 Once you have your pantry staples, all you’ll need is some fresh produce!
